  <h2><strong>Professional Experience</strong></h2>
  <p>
    An AI Engineer, Product Manager, and Entrepreneur with a deep passion for building real-world solutions that blend artificial intelligence, business strategy, and human-centric design. With hands-on experience leading AI teams and startups, I’ve spent the last few years diving into applied AI across industries like Environmental Health & Safety (EHS), business consulting, and education — always with a focus on speed, innovation, and impact.
Throughout these roles, I led cross-functional teams, integrated with external platforms, secured partnerships, and built 4 MVPs that brought real value to users. I’m results-driven, always pushing forward with clarity, agility, and purpose — whether that means delivering a safety system that flags helmet violations or an AI tool that accelerates startup ideation.
I believe in lean product thinking, in empowering people, and in turning complexity into clarity — not just for machines, but for teams and customers too. I love the rush of early-stage building, the responsibility of leadership, and the endless potential AI brings to everyday human challenges.
I excel in:
•	Leading AI-driven product development from 0 to 1.
•	Building and managing technical teams in agile environments.
•	Merging NLP, CV, and multimodal AI into real-world systems.
•	Startup strategy, and partnerships.
•	Creating technical workshops to empower businesses and teams.
